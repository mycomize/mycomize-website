                            By now you may have heard of microdosing. In case
                            you haven't, it consists of taking a small dose of a
                            psychedelic substance, such as psilocybin mushrooms,
                            on some set schedule. The goal is to keep the dose
                            small enough to avoid any hallucinogenic effects yet
                            large enough to still capture purported benefits,
                            including enhanced creativity, flow states, mental
                            clarity, and mood. In this post, you'll learn about
                            how microdosing works along with its benefits and
                            risks so you can make an informed decision about
                            whether microdosing is for you.

                            How Does Microdosing Work?
                        </h2>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Microdosing refers to the ingestion of a very low
                            dose of a psychedelic substance according to some
                            set schedule. The microdose is often described as
                            sub-perceptual, i.e., small enough to avoid getting
                            high. A better characterization would be{" "}
                            <em>subtle</em>-perceptual, where a slight change in
                            perception is felt, but still not enough to be
                            impaired nor experience any psychedelic effects.
                            This is in contrast to a macrodose, which is taken
                            with the intention to produce an intense psychedelic
                            trip that lasts for several hours.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This begs the question, what does "small enough"
                            mean exactly? And how does one go about measuring a
                            proper microdose for themselves? The answer varies
                            depending on the substance being used. For
                            psilocybin containing mushroom species, the
                            generally accepted range is between 0.1 and 0.5
                            grams of dried mushrooms{" "}
                            <a href="#ref1" className="text-blue-600">
                                [1]
                            </a>
                            . However there are some subtle factors to consider
                            before you start, and to understand them it helps to
                            have a basic understanding of the psilocybin
                            molecule and its contribution to psychoactive
                            potency across different mushroom variants, storage
                            conditions, and ingestion methods.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Another question is, how frequently should one
                            microdose? This is determined by the protocol that
                            one chooses. Below we will see several protocols
                            that are commonly used.

                            Psilocybin is a tryptamine that is a structural
                            analog to serotonin. Psilocybin itself is inactive.
                            It induces psychoactive effects only after being
                            dephosphorylated into psilocin

                            blood-brain barrier and binds to serotonin
                            receptors, particularly the 5-HT2A receptor. The
                            amount of psilocybin in a mushroom determines its
                            psychoactive potency. There are at least eight

                            mushroom storage is another factor in determining
                            potency. Psilocybin oxidizes rapidly in the presence
                            of light, air, and extreme temperatures, so
                            mushrooms stored in a ziplock bag will lose potency
                            faster relative to an air-tight mason jar or
                            vacuum-sealed bag that is kept in the dark.
                            Generally, the older the mushrooms, the less potent
                            they will be, so you have to adjust the dosage
                            accordingly in order to achieve the desired
                            microdose effect. Below is a chart that demonstrates

                            This leads to a gradual onset of effects in about 30
                            to 45 minutes, with peak effects around 90 minutes.
                            Eating them plain however can occasionally cause
                            mild nausea and stomach discomfort. To help prevent
                            this, some people grind the dried mushrooms into a
                            powder, then soak the powder in lemon juice for
                            about 20 minutes. This is called{" "}
                            <em>lemon-tekking</em>. The low pH of the lemon
                            juice helps to convert the psilocybin into psilocin,
                            in turn making it easier to digest. However another
                            consequence of the lemon-tek is the effects come on
                            faster and stronger, so if you choose to lemon-tek,
                            you may need to reduce the dosage to achieve the
                            desired microdose level{" "}

                            </a>
                            . Lemon-tekking is more common for large doses, but
                            in theory it can be done for microdosing as well.

                            Finally, the most important factor in determining
                            the proper microdose is one's unique biochemistry.
                            Everyone is different, so what works for one person
                            may not work for others. This is especially true for
                            people on medications, including those that act on
                            the serotonin system such as SSRIs. Mixing
                            psilocybin with SSRIs can lead to serious issues
                            such as

                        <p>
                            The protocol used for microdosing determines the
                            frequency of the dose and the amount of rest between
                            doses. The most popular protocols have been
                            established by leaders in the psychedelic research
                            community, including James Fadiman and Paul Stamets.
                            These protocols have been developed mostly through
                            anecdotal data rather than clinical trial data. The
                            reason is that psychoactive substances such as
                            psilocybin are very difficult to blind in a clinical
                            research setting. If you need FDA approval to tell
                            you it's OK, then microdosing just isn't for you, at
                            least not yet. The following protocols are described

                            As we will see in some detail below, there is
                            anecdotal evidence of benefits from these protocols,
                            and you can choose to experiment with different
                            schedules based on your preferences and feedback
                            from your body. The principle underlying each of
                            these is the same:
                            <em className="font-semibold">
                                {" "}
                                start low, go slow, and take time off
                            </em>
                            . Recall the standard range of microdoses is 0.1 to
                            0.5 grams. As shown above, potency can vary
                            depending on many factors, so if it is your first
                            time, you should start with a very small dose (less
                            than 0.1 grams). Buy a scale that is accurate to
                            hundredths of a gram so you can measure exactly how
                            much you're taking. Record how you feel based on the
                            dose. This will allow you to ease into higher doses
                            over time.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            If it is your first time taking psychedelics, dose
                            in a place where you feel comfortable, on a day when
                            you have no responsibilities, and with someone you
                            trust to be there for you just in case your body is
                            hyper-sensitive to psilocybin or you have an
                            extremely potent batch. At such low doses it is
                            unlikely to cause issues, but it is better to be
                            safe than sorry. The environment you dose in is
                            referred to as the <em>setting</em>. Setting is very
                            important for larger doses, and should also be
                            carefully considered if microdosing will be your
                            first experience with psychedelics.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In addition to setting, the other thing to be aware
                            of is your mindset (referred to simply as the{" "}
                            <em>set</em>), going into the dose. Set captures the
                            purpose of why you are microdosing in the first
                            place so that you can be intentional throughout the
                            protocol. It also captures your mood and stress
                            levels. If you are super stressed about something,
                            it is probably better to wait to start microdosing
                            until you are in a better place. Microdosing isn't a
                            panacea. It doesn't magically change stressful
                            situations without your intentional effort to
                            resolve them. That said, it can help you deal with
                            stress in a more healthy way. This is one of the
                            many benefits that people report from microdosing.

                            and sometimes surprising, benefits of microdosing.

                            below), so it is not logical to draw conclusions
                            about whether microdosing specifically causes these
                            benefits without controlling for other factors.
                            However, due to the sheer volume of reports, I think
                            they provide a solid baseline for experimentation
                            and further research.

                            Microdosing has been widely reported to enhance
                            cognition, sleep, athletic performance, and healthy
                            habit formation. A few of the cognitive benefits
                            include sustained focus, creativity, problem
                            solving, and mental clarity. Microdosing allows
                            people to enter a state of flow more easily, and
                            maintain sustained focus on difficult cognitive
                            tasks. It doesn't necessarily make one more creative

                            focus on intellectual tasks. Some report that
                            microdosing alone doesn't help much, however when
                            taken with ADHD medication, the microdose helps to
                            mitigate the medication's side effects.

                            enabled them to stop taking pharmaceutical
                            medications. A common theme is that microdosing
                            reconnects people with positive emotions, enabling

                            bacteria to take residence in the gut, in turn
                            lowering the inflammation that is characteristic of

                            If you've ever had chickenpox, you are at risk of
                            developing shingles. Shingles manifests as a painful
                            rash of blisters typically in the older population.
                            There have been at least three reports of people
                            with shingles that started microdosing and found
                            that their pain was greatly reduced. It is believed
                            that this worked by reducing inflammation rather
                            than directly attacking the virus. This is part of
                            an emerging view that microdosing can be an
                            effective alternative to conventional pain
                            relievers, such as NSAIDs and opioids. A survey

                            of microdosers with chronic pain (n=127) found that
                            67% associated it with a reduction in pain and a
                            statistically significant improvement in pain

                            those who set the intention of microdosing to
                            relieve pain achieved a statistically significant
                            decrease in perceived pain than those who did not
                            set such an intention.

                            By now you may be noticing a pattern. The physical
                            conditions discussed above all tend to have an
                            inflammatory component. Indeed, while much of the
                            research on macrodoses have focused on alleviating
                            mental health conditions, there is an emerging body
                            of data on microdosing suggests that psychedelics
                            act as anti-inflammatories in the brain and in
                            peripheral tissues. Psychedelics could offer an
                            alternative form of treatment or prevention for a
                            variety of conditions that have inflammation as the
                            root cause.

                            <br />
                            There are a lot of promising stories here and
                            emerging clinical data that is suggestive of the
                            benefits of microdosing. Skeptics often bring up the
                            placebo effect as a possible explanation for the
                            benefits reported. While one's mindset and
                            expectations are very important, especially at
                            higher doses, there has been work that shows real
                            neurophysiological changes in the brain even at
                            microdoses as measured by EEG recordings

                            . While most of the data has been anecdotal, it is
                            difficult to ignore the amount of positive reports
                            that have been collected so far. Some may balk at
                            the fact that an authority figure such as the FDA
                            hasn't approved microdosing due to a lack of hard
                            clinical trial data, however there is precedent in
                            modern medicine for depending on subjective data to
                            guide treatment.

                            when President Nixon passed the Controlled
                            Substances Act (CSA) in 1970. Despite the decades of
                            extensive psychiatric and neuroscientific research
                            into psychedelics that took place in the 50s and
                            60s, Nixon decided they should be considered
                            Schedule 1 substances. This means they allegedly
                            have no accepted medical use and have a high
                            potential for abuse. Based on what we know today,
                            this classification is simply disconnected from
                            reality. But the fact remains, on the federal level,

                            psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD comes with

                        The majority of microdosing reports are positive. Of the
                        reports that were negative, this was due to microdosing
                        not being effective at helping the condition at hand
                        rather than causing severe adverse effects. Since the
                        dose is so small, it is unlikely to cause psychological
                        distress. There have been some transient negative
                        physical effects reported, such as nausea and sleep
                        disturbances. In all reported cases, if negative effects
                        did arise, they went away by simply stopping the
                        microdosing protocol. Microdosing and psychedelics are
                        not addictive, so stopping once you start should not be
                        a problem.

                        One of the unfortunate side effects of making
                        psychedelics Schedule 1 is there is no regulated market
                        for legitimate psychedelic substances. This means you
                        need to be careful in how you source your mushrooms. If
                        you are not growing them yourself, then be sure to get
                        them from someone you trust. Be wary of any psilocybin
                        in pill form, especially from someone you don't really
                        know (like a random off the internet), as there is
                        greater risk for it being laced with other substances.
                        When you have a trustworthy source, it is easier to be
                        confident in the dose amount so that you can properly
                        measure a microdose.

                        that they rank among the most profound and meaningful
                        experiences of their life, but nonetheless they can be
                        quite intense and scary in the moment. These issues
                        should never be a problem for a proper microdose though.
                        Start low, go slow, and take time off.

                        other mental health conditions and medications. If you
                        have generalized anxiety, bipolar disorder, or
                        schizophrenia, you should do plenty of research and
                        consult with your psychiatrist before embarking on any
                        psychedelic use, including microdosing. The same goes

                        recommend avoiding microdosing if you are on Tramadol or
                        Lithium (they don't say why). That book contains a long
                        list of medications that people have taken alongside
                        microdosing, so be sure to check it out before you
                        start. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of
                        contraindications. As always, consult with your doctor
                        before you make any changes.
